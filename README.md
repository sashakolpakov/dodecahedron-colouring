# Dodecahedron colourings

Ancillary files for arXiv:2203.01997

Extensions of colourings are defined in (arXiv:2203.01997). We pick one particular small cover of the right-angled dodecahedron described by Garrison and Scott in (arXiv:math/0107116), and classify the DJ-equivalence classes of its extensions. We also compute their coloured symmetry groups and integral homology. In order to verify our computations, please run the SageMath code in "QHS-dodecahedron-bounding.ipynb".
